## üéØ Usage Guide
Protecting and accessing your websites with SiteLock is straightforward:
  

### üîπ Securing a Website

1. **Visit the Target Website:** Navigate to the specific website you wish to protect using SiteLock.

2. **Click the SiteLock Icon:** Locate and click the SiteLock extension icon in your Chrome toolbar (usually located in the top right corner of your browser window).

3. **Choose Authentication Method:** You will be prompted to choose your preferred authentication method for this website:
	-   **Password:** Set a strong password for robust protection.
	-   **PIN:** Use PIN for quicker access.

5.** Complete Setup:** click the "Confirm" button after setting up the appropriate authentication method (password or PIN) to secure access to the site.

  

### üîπ Accessing a Locked Website

1. **Open Protected Website:** When you or anyone else attempts to open a website protected by SiteLock, the extension will automatically intercept the request.

2. **Authentication Prompt:** Instead of directly loading the website content, SiteLock will redirect you to an **authentication page**. This page will prompt you to verify your identity.

3.**Verify Your Identity:** On the authentication page, you will need to authenticate using the method you set up for that specific website:
 -  **Enter your Password:** If you chose password protection, enter the password you configured.
-   **Enter your PIN:** If you opted for PIN protection, enter your designated PIN.
    
-   **Use Passkey:** If passkey authentication is enabled, follow the prompts to use your passkey device or method.

4. **Access Granted:** Upon successful verification of your credentials (correct password, PIN, or valid passkey), SiteLock will grant you access to the originally requested website. You will be automatically redirected to the intended website content and can begin browsing.

5. **Session Duration:** SiteLock intelligently manages your session. Once you have successfully authenticated, your access to the protected website will remain **active as long as you have at least one tab open for that site**. This means you can navigate freely within the website without needing to re-authenticate repeatedly during your browsing session.
6. **Automatic Session Revocation:** The security of SiteLock is enhanced by its automatic session management. As soon as you **close all open tabs related to the protected website**, SiteLock automatically revokes your access. This ensures that when you revisit the site later, or if someone else gains access to your browser after you're done, re-authentication will be required, maintaining a high level of security.

  

### üîπ Managing Locked Websites

SiteLock provides an easy-to-use settings page to manage your protected websites:

1.  **Access Settings:** Click the SiteLock extension icon in your Chrome toolbar. In the extension popup, click on the **"Settings"** button.
2. **View Protected Websites:** The Settings page will display a comprehensive list of all websites that are currently protected by SiteLock. This list allows you to see all your secured sites at a glance.

3. **Manage Protection:** For each website in the list, you will have options to manage its protection settings. This typically includes:
	-   **Removing Protection:** Clicking the delete icon likely functions as a "Remove" action for that specific website. This would immediately or after confirmation remove SiteLock protection for the selected site.
    
	-   **Verification Prompts :** If SiteLock prioritizes security, clicking the delete icon may trigger a verification step, requiring you to enter a password, PIN, or passkey before the removal process is completed.

By using the Settings page, you have full control over your protected websites, allowing you to easily add, remove, and manage website protection as needed, all within a user-friendly interface.
  

## üîí Security Considerations

Understanding SiteLock's security model is important for optimal use:

- **In-Memory Authentication Data:** For enhanced security, authentication data and session states are **exclusively stored in your browser's memory**. This means that sensitive information is not persisted to disk, minimizing the risk of unauthorized access if your system is compromised while powered off. However, it also implies that:

-   **Session Reset on Browser Closure:** All authentication sessions and protected website access are completely **reset when you close your browser or restart your computer**. This is a deliberate security feature to ensure that every new browsing session starts with a clean security slate, requiring re-authentication for protected sites.
-   **Re-authentication After Tab Closure:** As a core security feature, you will **always need to re-authenticate** after you close all tabs of a protected website and then revisit it. This ensures that access is explicitly granted each time you intend to use a protected site, preventing persistent, unattended sessions.
-   **Origin-Level Protection:** SiteLock enforces protection at the **origin level**. This is a crucial security design choice to prevent subdomain bypasses. Protecting a domain like `example.com` automatically extends protection to all its subdomains (e.g., `blog.example.com`, `api.example.com`). This ensures comprehensive security for the entire website and its related services, simplifying protection management and eliminating potential security loopholes through subdomains.
